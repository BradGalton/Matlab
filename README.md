# Matlab Projects

1) MaxSubSum: Calculates the sum and locates the coordinates of elements for the maximum-valued contiguous submatrix.

2) Saddle: Locates saddle points within a matrix.

3) SparseArray: Efficient output of a sparse array's elements to a binary file.

Machine Learning: 

Scripts adapted from Machine Learning course labs at Stanford. Problem formulation and datsets provided by instructor. All functions self-generated but may use dependencies not provided here.
